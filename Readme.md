# Using LUX For Automatic Visual Exploration

This repository was created as a short exercise during a seminar in my uni's data science program.
The conda environment used to work in the notebook is documented in the file `environment.yml`.

## Takeaways

- The LUX approach to automatic visual exploration is very promising
- "Optimal datasets" yield extremely good results
- LUX doesn't handle data with "bad quality" very well
- Wrangling data while LUX being active is a very painful experience as the widget takes precedence over the pandas renderer
- LUX doesn't automatically pick up on datetime indices (you have to copy it to a column)
- If you already have a good intuition about your data you can use LUX to your advantage
- Temporal plots without explicit intents aren't helpful
- Learning how to express "intent" in LUX could be very beneficial
- Apart from PowerBI first time I've seen "conversational visual exploration"
